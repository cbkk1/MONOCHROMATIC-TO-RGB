## ðŸš€ Project Overview

**MONOCHROMATIC-TO-RGB** is a web application built with Flask that takes a single-channel (monochrome) image as input, processes it through a colorization pipeline, and returns a fully colorized RGB image. Processing progress is logged in the terminal; once complete, the result is displayed in your browser.
